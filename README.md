# Counter App A simple interactive counter built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. This project was created to practice DOM manipulation, event handling, and adding extra features like localStorage and keyboard shortcuts. --- ## 
 Features - **Increment / Decrement buttons** to change the counter value - **Step size input** to control how much the counter changes - **Color feedback** when the counter goes positive, negative, or zero - **Keyboard shortcuts** (`ArrowUp`, `ArrowDown`, `R` for reset) - **LocalStorage support** so the counter value is saved even after refreshing ---

Using localStorage to persist data
